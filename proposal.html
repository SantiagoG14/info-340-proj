    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>

        <h2>Problem Description:</h2>

        <p>Finding the most relevant and helpful study resources out of all the available ones online for different classes is a struggle that every student faces. Common subjects such as calculus and chemistry are taught in every university, using different textbooks, and notations. It can be hard for students to find the best resource since classes can be grouped under different names, and use methods not taught in class to teach the material. An article by WGU Labs details how daunting it is for students to find good study materials due to the sheer amount available: “But when students encounter hundreds of unorganized search results on the university website, it’s easy for students to become quickly overwhelmed. Search results may include multiple, irrelevant listings, and unrelated links, or out-of-date information.” (Streeper 2022). Specifically relating to information technology, students face the problem of having trouble finding relevant study resources online that don’t include unnecessary information or irrelevant practice problems without taking time to look through multiple resources. </p>

        <p>The information technology problem that will be addressing is the lack of personalized study resources specifically for University of Washington classes. One previous attempt to solve this problem is an app called Quizlet. This app has an archive of flashcards for a variety of topics, so users can test themselves on their knowledge. However, this is insufficient because most flashcards are on general knowledge and not specific to UW, and some are locked behind a paywall (see source 2 for an example). This makes it difficult for UW students to study for their niche classes because they will have to look through multiple flashcard decks to see which ones are relevant which wastes time. </p>

            <h2>App Description:</h2>
            
            <p>
                Our solution is UW Study Hub, a web application to connect UW students 
                with curated study materials, tailor-made for each course at UW. Each course 
                will have a page capable of holding notes, practicing problems, and organizing 
                resources, matching the exact syllabus and teaching style.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our app has three major interactive features to make that happen. First, 
                resource submission will enable students to upload or link to material they found 
                helpful, such as typed summaries, YouTube tutorials, or problem sets. Second, 
                personal organization and the "half" feature will allow users to bookmark, tag, 
                or reorder their favorite study aids to create a personalized "study playlist." 
                Finally, collaborative review will provide peer feedback and ratings to help 
                everyone quickly identify the most effective materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our team will keep the focus only on UW-specific classes so that students do not 
                have to dig through irrelevant information. This method cuts both time and 
                frustration, providing direct, centralized study tools at one's fingertips. 
                The web app will store user uploads and preferences in a simple database for 
                consistency across sessions with their resources and bookmarks intact. This will 
                motivate ongoing collaboration between classmates.
