        <h2>Problem Description:</h2>

        <p>Finding the most relevant and helpful study resources out of all the available ones online for different classes is a struggle that every student faces. Common subjects such as calculus and chemistry are taught in every university, using different textbooks, and notations. It can be hard for students to find the best resource since classes can be grouped under different names, and use methods not taught in class to teach the material. An article by WGU Labs details how daunting it is for students to find good study materials due to the sheer amount available: “But when students encounter hundreds of unorganized search results on the university website, it’s easy for students to become quickly overwhelmed. Search results may include multiple, irrelevant listings, and unrelated links, or out-of-date information.” (Streeper 2022). Specifically relating to information technology, students face the problem of having trouble finding relevant study resources online that don’t include unnecessary information or irrelevant practice problems without taking time to look through multiple resources. </p>

        <p>The information technology problem that will be addressing is the lack of personalized study resources specifically for University of Washington classes. One previous attempt to solve this problem is an app called Quizlet. This app has an archive of flashcards for a variety of topics, so users can test themselves on their knowledge. However, this is insufficient because most flashcards are on general knowledge and not specific to UW, and some are locked behind a paywall (see source 2 for an example). This makes it difficult for UW students to study for their niche classes because they will have to look through multiple flashcard decks to see which ones are relevant which wastes time. </p>
